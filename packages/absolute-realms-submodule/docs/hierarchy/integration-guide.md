# Hierarchy Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the Absolute Realms hierarchy structure with existing systems and workflows in your GitHub Enterprise environment.

## Integration Overview

The Absolute Realms hierarchy provides a structured approach to organizing GitHub Enterprise resources. This integration guide will help you connect the hierarchical visualization with your existing systems and processes.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating the hierarchy, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your GitHub Enterprise instance
- Appropriate permissions for creating and managing organizations and teams
- Understanding of your current GitHub Enterprise structure and workflows

## Integration with GitHub Enterprise API

The hierarchical chart application can interact with GitHub Enterprise through the GitHub API. This integration allows you to:

1. Automatically create organizations, teams, and repositories that align with the hierarchy
2. Synchronize changes made in the chart with your GitHub Enterprise instance
3. Import existing structures from GitHub Enterprise into the chart

### API Configuration

To configure the API integration:

1. Create a GitHub App or Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
2. Update the API configuration in the chart application:

```typescript
// Configure in src/services/api.ts
export const githubApiConfig = {
  baseUrl: 'https://github.enterprise.yourdomain.com/api/v3',
  token: process.env.GITHUB_API_TOKEN,
  // Additional configuration options
};
```

3. Test the integration using the built-in connectivity check

## Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

The hierarchy can be integrated with your existing CI/CD pipelines to automate governance and compliance:

1. Add hierarchy validation checks to pull request workflows
2. Automatically update team memberships when the hierarchy changes
3. Generate reports on organization structure and access patterns

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Hierarchy Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'hierarchy-data.json'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Validate Hierarchy
        run: pnpm --filter absolute-realms-submodule validate-hierarchy
```

## Integration with Identity Management

To integrate the hierarchy with your identity management system:

1. Configure SAML SSO for each organization in the hierarchy
2. Map identity provider groups to GitHub teams based on the hierarchy
3. Implement automated provisioning and deprovisioning based on hierarchy changes

## Integration with Existing Repositories

To apply the hierarchy to existing repositories:

1. Use the repository import feature in the chart application
2. Apply appropriate classifications and team assignments
3. Update repository settings to align with hierarchy standards

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

Common integration issues and solutions:

- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate caching and rate limit handling
- **Permission Conflicts**: Audit existing permissions before applying hierarchy changes
- **Synchronization Errors**: Use the built-in reconciliation tools to resolve conflicts

## Next Steps

After successfully integrating the hierarchy:

1. Train administrators on managing the hierarchy
2. Document organization-specific conventions and exceptions
3. Schedule regular audits to ensure alignment between the hierarchy and actual GitHub Enterprise structure
