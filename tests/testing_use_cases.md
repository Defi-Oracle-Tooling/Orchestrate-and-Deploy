# UC-001: Generate YAML Mapping from Azure Quota CSV

**Purpose:**  
Confirm that the orchestrator correctly parses Azure quota data from a CSV file and outputs a normalized YAML mapping.

**Prerequisites:**  
- CSV file is placed at:  
  `monorepo/packages/orchestrator-engine/data/quotas/QuotaUsage_2025-04-04T14_42_52.csv`

**Steps:**  
1. Open the VS Code terminal in the root of the monorepo.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   yarn workspace orchestrator-engine generate-mapping

	3.	Open the generated file at:

monorepo/packages/orchestrator-engine/data/quotas/live-quotas.yaml


	4.	Verify that the YAML structure looks similar to:

eastus:
  DSv4:
    total: 128
    used: 96
    available: 32
    assigned_to:
      - validator



Expected Output:
A properly formatted live-quotas.yaml file reflecting the quota data.

### File: **UC-002_Validate_Deployment_Eligibility.md**

```markdown
# UC-002: Validate Deployment Eligibility for a Role in a Region

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the orchestrator (via CLI or API) correctly validates quota availability for deploying a node in a specified region.

**CLI Testing Steps:**  
1. Start the orchestrator engine (if not already running):
   ```bash
   yarn workspace orchestrator-engine start

	2.	In the CLI, type:

validate-quota eastus validator


	3.	Observe the output (should be true if the quota is available, otherwise false).

API Testing Steps:
	1.	Open your browser or API client and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000/api/quotas?region=eastus&role=validator


	2.	Verify that the response shows quota details for the given region and role.

Expected Output:
	•	CLI returns true or false based on available quota.

**Purpose:**  
Automatically suggest an alternative region with available quota for a specified node role.

**Steps:**  
1. In the orchestrator CLI (or via API), run:
   ```bash
   suggest-region validator

	2.	Alternatively, call via REST API:

curl http://localhost:3000/api/quotas/suggestions/validator


	3.	Check that the output returns the name of a region (e.g., eastus) where the role has available quota.

Expected Output:
The first region found that satisfies the quota requirements (e.g., eastus), or a message indicating no region is available.

**Purpose:**  
Provide usage statistics (total, used, available, usage percentage) across regions for a specified node role.

**Steps:**  
1. Run the CLI command:
   ```bash
   summarize-availability validator

	2.	Review the output, which should be a JSON-like summary:

{
  "eastus": {
    "total": 128,
    "used": 96,
    "available": 32,
    "usage_percent": "75.00"
